# Clustering Analysis of Potential Locations for Virtual Hotel Business Development in South Jakarta, Indonesia

Low budget traveling and staycation has become a common needs for young people in Indonesia, espescially in its capital city, Jakarta. To accomodate this needs, several virtual hotel operators (e.g., OYO, RedDoorz, and Airy) have rapidly developed their business in this city. This type of accommodation has become a favorite choice amongst travelers because its simplicity, easyness to book, and lower price compared to other hotel operators. 

South Jakarta is a very promising area to develop this kind of business. There are plenty of popular restaurants, caffees, shopping malls, nightlife entertainments, and other interesting places in this area that would attract guests to stay in this area. But, opening a new business unit in this area does not guarantee that it will be a pleasant place to stay for the guests. It has to be opened in the right, strategic location so guests can have great experience while staying. 

Fortunately, Google Map, a popular navigation app can accomodate its users to give to rate any particular places, including hotels. The rating value ranges from 0 to 5, where 0 means very unpleasant an 5 means excellent satisfatory. These ratings is considerable to be used as satisfactory measurement by hotel guests.

In this project, we will develop a classification machine learning model to determine whether each particular location shall be a promising location for the hotel business to expand, or not. Moreover, this project aims to find locations that will have 4-5 rating if a new hotel built in each particular location. And then, we will create clusters of potential area for opening a new VHO franchise.

The result of this project is expected to be able to bring insights for virtual hotel operators that interested in opening a new franchise in South Jakarta Area. As South Jakarta is a vast area, several loations recommended in the result section can be used as starting points for further analyses prior to make a business decision.
